Issue Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a file reference is added within a *Text Field (multi-line)* field (such as {*}Description{*}) in the same line with text and then copied to a Comment, the reference is incorrect.

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe suggestion relates to how pinning a field works today. At the moment, to be able to pin the field, you need to hover over the area in front of the field name, but to unpin it, you can hover over the name.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is to make it homogeneous and either hover over the name for both actions (pin, unpin) or add an opaque pin icon in front of the name to identify the area, as it's done for the pinned field.\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n # Open an issue\r\n # Try pining the field by hovering over the name (no action)\r\n # Pin the file by hovering over the active area in front of the name\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n-Have the same ability to pin and unpin the field the same way; show and un-show the pin icon the same way and have no variation to facilitate the task.\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n-The action today is to pin the field; you have to hover over the active area in front of the field, and to unpin, you can hover over the name, which does not happen for pinning.\r\n\r\n-What remains inconsistent is the way the icon\r\nappears: it appears when hovering over the entire row to unpin, versus only\r\nover the small, invisible icon area to pin.\r\n\r\n ","customfield_16630":null,"customfield_10650":null,"customfield_14733":"2|i426cv:","customfield_14734":"1|i426j3:","customfield_10651":null,"customfield_18931":null,"customfield_12831":null,"customfield_14731":"1|i410jw:","customfield_18932":null,"customfield_10653":null,"customfield_12830":null,"customfield_14732":"1|i426iv:","timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/attachment/455693","id":"455693","filename":"Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 10.48.16 a.m..png","author":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/user?username=25062f4275ed","name":"25062f4275ed","key":"JIRAUSER6977721","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990","24x24":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990","16x16":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990","32x32":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990"},"displayName":"Isai Navarro","active":true,"timeZone":"UTC"},"created":"2024-04-17T16:53:23.903+0000","size":72150,"mimeType":"image/png","content":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/455693/Screenshot+2024-04-17+at+10.48.16%E2%80%AFa.m..png","thumbnail":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/thumbnail/455693/_thumb_455693.png"},{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/attachment/455692","id":"455692","filename":"Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 10.48.53 a.m..png","author":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/user?username=25062f4275ed","name":"25062f4275ed","key":"JIRAUSER6977721","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990","24x24":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990","16x16":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990","32x32":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=JIRAUSER6977721&avatarId=8050990"},"displayName":"Isai Navarro","active":true,"timeZone":"UTC"},"created":"2024-04-17T16:53:23.856+0000","size":45629,"mimeType":"image/png","content":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/455692/Screenshot+2024-04-17+at+10.48.53%E2%80%AFa.m..png","thumbnail":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/thumbnail/455692/_thumb_455692.png"}],"customfield_21930":"<b>Not checked existing issues?

Issue Summary\r\n\r\nAs a Jira administrator, I want to be able to use any field or a custom field of any type across all applicable features and functionality, because it's not expected that random fields or certain types of custom fields would be ignored or inaccessible.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we do have custom fields shared between these Projects, however, fields such as 'Story Points' (that is replaced by 'Story points estimate' in TM Projects), 'Flagged', 'Restrict To', and other similar fields that are not shared between them causing a difference in logic that could be quite complex for Jira administrators to explain to end-users.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is to not overcomplicate things and keep it simple, as performing X activity in a Company Managed project should have the same action as performing X activity in a Team Managed project, but with a reduced scope.\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this Feature is to simplify the difference in behavior between a Team-Managed and Company-Managed projects to facilitate Jira administrators to educate end-users. The minimum goal would be to have relevant *system fields* available for all projects, such as:\r\n * Story Points\r\n * Flagged\r\n * Restrict To\r\n * Others\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\nThe difference between these fields for each type of Project creates an extra complexity for end-users, and the fields are not the same for Team Managed and Project Managed fields. \r\nh3.
